          <h3>What do we do?</h3>
          <p>
            SureSitter was founded by parents, for parents, to help make it easy
            for you to find childcare that others in your community know, trust
            and use. The first thing to say is that we’re not a babysitting or
            nanny agency, but a marketplace, with the aim of giving all of us as
            parents the ability to view, review and make choices about the
            childcare options available to us. We are not a childcare agency. We
            do not personally meet or vet the caregivers on our platform.
            Instead we provide parents with the tools and connections to help
            find the best caregivers that will work for you and your family.
          </p>
          <h3>How do I sign-up to SureSitter as a parent?</h3>
          <p>
            Signing up is really simple.  Click on this link. You will then
            receive an email asking you to confirm your account. You must
            confirm your account before your profile will be live onSureSitter.
          </p>
          <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
          <p>
            It’s FREE to post a job and review childminder profiles. You only
            pay when you find suitable carers that you want to connect with. We
            offer a number of options to suit all families. This includes a
            one-off, no-commitment option of 3 months full access or a monthly
            subscription option, which can be cancelled at any time. See our
            pricing page for further details. Also included in the annual
            subscription is Garda vetting on request. See our Garda vetting page
            for more details. SureSitter does not set the rates of pay for
            childminders and babysitters. Parents and childminders agree on this
            together once we have made the introductions.
          </p>
          <h3>Are the carers background checked?</h3>
          <p>
            Trust is at the heart of our platform. As parents ourselves of small
            children we understand how important it is to find a trusted
            childminder or nanny. We do not carry out background checks. We
            recommend that you check all employment history, references,
            immigration and visa status so you can be sure that you are making
            the most informed decision possible. We provide parents with the
            tools necessary to enable you to find the right caregiver for you
            and your family. We also carry out ID-verification checks. This
            provides you with an additional layer of trust. If a sitter has been
            ID-verified you will see the following badge on their profile. We do
            this by working with the 3rd party providers used by some of the
            world’s biggest financial institutions and marketplaces like us.
