            job in Ireland and are aged over 18 then weâ€™d love you to join our
            GoNanny community.

          <h3 className="fw-bold mb-3">Are there any age restrictions?</h3>
          <p className="mb-5">You must be over 18 to join GoNanny.</p>
          <h3 className="fw-bold mb-3">How much will it cost me? </h3>
          <p>Nothing! There is no charge to join GoNanny.</p>
          <h3 className="fw-bold mb-3">How do I get paid?</h3>
          <p className="mb-5">
            Parents will pay you directly and you keep all the money you earn,
            we do not take a percentage. GoNanny does not set the rate that you
            are paid. This is agreed directly between the parent and
            nanny/childminder. We recommend that how and when payments are made
            are agreed at this stage too.
          </p>
          <h3 className="fw-bold mb-3">Who is behind GoNany?</h3>
          <p className="mb-5">
            GoNanny was founded by number of workings parents who struggled to
            find suitable childcare. The business is backed by a great team of
            advisors, parents, and childminders whose ultimate goal is to create
            the best experience possible for parents and carers. Here is some
            information About Us.
